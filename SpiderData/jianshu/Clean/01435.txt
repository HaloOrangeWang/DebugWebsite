There was a problem importing one of the Python modules
required to run yum. The error leading to this problem was:

/root/anaconda3/lib/liblzma.so.5: version `XZ_5.1.2alpha' not found (required by /lib64/librpmio.so.3)

Please install a package which provides this module, or
verify that the module is installed correctly.

It's possible that the above module doesn't match the
current version of Python, which is:
2.7.5 (default, Aug 4 2017, 00:39:18)
[GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-16)]

解决办法:

vim .bash_profile

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib64/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

source .bash_profile

解决

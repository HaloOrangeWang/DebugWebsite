UserWarning: No parser was explicitly specified, so I'm using the best available HTML parser for this system ("lxml"). This usually isn't a problem, but if you run this code on another system, or in a different virtual environment, it may use a different parser and behave differently.

解决方式：

BeautifulSoup(data[1],"lxml")

BeautifulSoup增加lxml参数

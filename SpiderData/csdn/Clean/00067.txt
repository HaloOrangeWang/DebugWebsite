执行python setup.py install命令想要安装一个python包却出错了，这时候出错信息如下：

running install
error: can't create or remove files in install directory

The following error occurred while trying to add or remove files in the
installation directory:

[Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\\Program Files\\Python\\Lib\\site-packages\\test-easy-install-2960.write-test'

The installation directory you specified (via --install-dir, --prefix, or
the distutils default setting) was:

C:\Program Files\Python\Lib\site-packages\

Perhaps your account does not have write access to this directory?  If the
installation directory is a system-owned directory, you may need to sign in
as the administrator or "root" account.  If you do not have administrative
access to this machine, you may wish to choose a different installation
directory, preferably one that is listed in your PYTHONPATH environment
variable.

For information on other options, you may wish to consult the
documentation at:

https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html

Please make the appropriate changes for your system and try again.

那么该如何解决呢?
 使用管理员模式打开CMD终端再执行相应命令即可。

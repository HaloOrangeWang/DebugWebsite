When running the following code:

try:

key=int(input())

except ValueError as string:

print("Error is within:",string)

for example, if one puts 'rrr' this exception will rise, since 'rrr' does not support (int)

However, instead ot putting the actual string, it puts: "invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'rrr' "

How do I make it work so that the variable 'string' actually gets the wrong input that the user gave (in this example, I want it to print: 'Error is within: rrr')

Thanks a lot

Your issue comes from the fact that the variable string is the error message for a ValueError exception. If you wanted to print out the user's invalid input, you would need to create a variable that stores the user's input before your try/except. For example:

userInput = input()

try:

key=int(userInput)

except ValueError:

print("Error is within:",userInput)

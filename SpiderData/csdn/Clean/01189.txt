报错一

python配置opencv本来好好的，用了一天不知道为什么就不好使了。报错如下（没截全）：

The function is not implemented. Rebuild the library with Windows, GTK+ 2.x or Carbon support.

看网上的方法是  pip opencv-contrib-python ，但是我用了之后……没有什么用……T_T

只好 pip uninstall opencv-python & pip uninstall opencv-contrib-python 之后下了特定版本号的opencv。

没想到又能行了！
 pip install opencv-python==3.4.13.47 & pip install opencv-contrib-python==3.4.13.47


报错二

OMP: Hint This means that multiple copies of the OpenMP runtime have been linked into the program. That is dangerous, since it can degrade performance or cause incorrect results. The best thing to do is to ensure that only a single OpenMP runtime is linked into the process, e.g. by avoiding static linking of the OpenMP runtime in any library. As an unsafe, unsupported, undocumented workaround you can set the environment variable KMP_DUPLICATE_LIB_OK=TRUE to allow the program to continue to execute, but that may cause crashes or silently produce incorrect results.

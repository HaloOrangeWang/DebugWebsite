Do I need to install pip?

pip is already installed if you are using Python 2 >=2.7.9 or Python 3 >=3.4 downloaded from ​​python.org​​​ or if you are working in a ​​Virtual Environment​​​ created by ​​virtualenv​​​ or ​​pyvenv​​​. Just make sure to ​​upgrade pip​​.


Installing with get-pip.py

To install pip, securely download ​​get-pip.py​​​. ​​[1]​​:

Inspect ​​get-pip.py​​ for any malevolence. Then run the following:

到这一步的时候，如果python2的pip坏了，就运行：python2 get-pip.py

如果是python3的pip坏了，升级就运行：python3 get-pip.py

Warning

Be cautious if you are using a Python install that is managed by your operating system or another package manager. ​​get-pip.py​​ does not coordinate with those tools, and may leave your system in an inconsistent state.  ​​get-pip.py​​ also installs ​​​setuptools​​​ ​​[2]​​​ and ​​wheel​​​ if they are not already. ​​setuptools​​​ is required to install ​​source distributions​​​. Both are required in order to build a ​​Wheel Cache​​​ (which improves installation speed), although neither are required to install pre-built ​​wheels​​.

Note

The get-pip.py script is supported on the same python version as pip. For the now unsupported Python 2.6, alternate script is available ​​here​​.


get-pip.py options

​​--no-setuptools​​

If set, do not attempt to install ​​setuptools​​

​​--no-wheel​​

If set, do not attempt to install ​​wheel​​

​​get-pip.py​​ allows ​​​pip install options​​​ and the ​​general options​​. Below are some examples:

Install from local copies of pip and setuptools:

Install to the user site ​​[3]​​:

Install behind a proxy:


Using Linux Package Managers

See ​​Installing pip/setuptools/wheel with Linux Package Managers​​​ in the ​​Python Packaging User Guide​​.

Python and OS Compatibility

pip works with CPython versions 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6 and also pypy.

This means pip works on the latest patch version of each of these minor versions. Previous patch versions are supported on a best effort approach.

pip works on Unix/Linux, macOS, and Windows.

"Secure" in this context means using a modern browser or a tool like curl that verifies SSL certificates when downloading from https URLs.

​​[2]​​

Beginning with pip v1.5.1, ​​get-pip.py​​ stopped requiring setuptools to be installed first.

​​[3]​​

The pip developers are considering making ​​--user​​ the default for all installs, including ​​get-pip.py​​ installs of pip, but at this time, ​​--user​​ installs for pip itself, should not be considered to be fully tested or endorsed. For discussion, see ​​​Issue 1668​​.

在安装aliyunsdkcore 模块时，遇到如下报错：

Installing collected packages: pycrypto, aliyunsdkcore
  Running setup.py install for pycrypto ... error

安装pycrypto失败，查询解决方法如下：

I'm also get the same error. An error occurred because of a different version from the script. So, i've created a script that is less sensitive to build tool version. It works well. Thanks!

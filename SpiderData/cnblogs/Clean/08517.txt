There is a Bug with fmod on windows, see https://tinyurl.com/y3dm3h86

To prevent unexpected runtime behavior, opencv contains a Check for this:

Workaround

This is a windows issue and has to be fixed by Microsoft, however, a fix has not arrived for several weeks now.

Pinning against NumPy 1.19.3 should help (it uses a newer OpenBLAS version, but this caused other problems). This can be achieved using e.g. with pip install numpy==1.19.3 or similar depending on your setup. To be clear: The only difference between NumPy 1.19.3 and 1.19.4 is the OpenBLAS version it ships.

32bit Python does not have these issues

In principle you could revert the buggy windows update or deactivate the _win_os_check in NumPy (if you are lucky, your code is unaffected by the bug).

原因：是1.19.4版本有问题，需要安装1.19.3版本

更换版本后使用 import numpy

numpy.__version__ 可以查看该版本号

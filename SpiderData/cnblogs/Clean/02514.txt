Certificate verification and OpenSSL

This variant of Python 3.7 includes its own private copy of OpenSSL 1.1.0.  The deprecated Apple-supplied OpenSSL libraries are no longer used.  This means that the trust certificates in system and user keychains managed by the Keychain Access application and the security command line utility are no longer used as defaults by the Python ssl module.  A sample command script is included in /Applications/Python 3.7 to install a curated bundle of default root certificates from the third-party certifi package (https://pypi.org/project/certifi/).  If you choose to use certifi, you should consider subscribing to the project's email update service to be notified when the certificate bundle is updated.

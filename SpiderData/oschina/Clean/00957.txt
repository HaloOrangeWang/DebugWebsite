报错：invalid index of a 0-dim tensor. Use tensor.item() to convert a 0-dim tensor to a Python number

解决方法：

That's because in PyTorch>=0.5, the index of 0-dim tensor is invalid. The master branch is designed for PyTorch 0.4.1, loss_val.data[0] works well.

Try to change

total_loss += loss_val.data[0]
loss_values = [v.data[0] for v in losses]

to

total_loss += loss_val.data
loss_values = [v.data for v in losses]

might fix the problem.

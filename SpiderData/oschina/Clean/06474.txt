在非salt-api的主机上测试api连通性，测试代码如下:

#!/usr/bin/env python

import pycurl
import StringIO
import ssl
ssl._create_default_https_context = ssl._create_unverified_context

报错：

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "salt_api.py", line 36, in <module>
    api_login()
  File "salt_api.py", line 24, in api_login
    ch.perform()
pycurl.error: (51, "SSL: certificate subject name 'localhost' does not match target host name 'localdomain'")

方法一： 把测试的代码迁移到salt-api所在的机器，因为本地有认证需要的证书，

When you post to (or access in any way) a https url, the SSL/TLS process starts with the server giving the client a certificate. The client expects the name in the certificate to be identical to the server name in the URL.
In your case, you've installed a self-signed certificate. When you created a certificate signing request (CSR) with OpenSSL, you didn't specify a host name ('subject' in certificate-speak), so OpenSSL tied to autodetect the hostname. It found "localhost.localdomain", which is unfortunate, since that is a name that is used on all systems to reference the system itself. A proper domain name would have been better, but that's not the reason you're getting an SSL error.
The error message appears because you're accessing the https page using an IP address (https://xx.xx.xx.xx/someurl), not the host name (https://localhost.localdomain/someurl). Since the certificate wasn't (and cannot be) issued to an IP address, SSL negotiation fails.
Try using "localhost.localdomain" instead of the IP address. (And if that works, consider generating a new certificate issued to a proper hostname.)

方法二： 在非salt-api所在机器上部署，需要作如下操作：

pip install  PyOpenSSL

否则会报错：

'tls' __virtual__ returned False: PyOpenSSL version 0.10 or later must be installed before this module can be used.

生成证书：

(fourthgen) [root@test107 fourthgen]# salt-call tls.create_self_signed_cert  
local:
    Certificate "localhost" already exists
    
证书路径在：
/etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt
/etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key

拷贝证书：
cp /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt /etc/pki/tls/private/

修改/etc/hosts,添加：
10.10.32.102 localhost
，将salt-api url改成“https://localhost:8000/login”

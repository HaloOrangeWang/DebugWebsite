执行sql:　　　

SELECT ability,count
FROM 
(
SELECT
q.ability,
count( 1 ) as count
FROM
spk_wrong_que_train t
LEFT JOIN spk_hsk_question q ON t.question_id = q.id
WHERE
t.user_id = 1
group by
q.ability

UNION
SELECT '1' as ability,'0' as count
union 
SELECT '3' as ability,'0' as count
union 
SELECT '4' as ability,'0' as count
union 
SELECT '5' as ability,'0' as count
union 
SELECT '6' as ability,'0' as count

) B
GROUP BY B.ability

结果：执行成功

　　

5.7以上版本 结果：报错

问题：

报错信息：　　1055 - Expression #2 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause and contains nonaggregated column 'B.count' which is not functionally dependent on columns in GROUP BY clause; this is incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by

　由于本地环境mysql 是5.7以下版本，线上5.7以上版本：

解决：

　　　　使用ANY_VALUE（），MySQL会忽略每个名称组中的地址值的不确定性并接受查询，就可以了！
